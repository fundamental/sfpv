NAME
----
sfpv - static function property verification a C/C++ static analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sfpv* ['OPTIONS'] FILES

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sfpv* is a clang based static analysis tool to verify that functions have some
listed property through the use of annotations and a basic deduction system.
The primary goal of this program is to show realtime safety bugs in audio
software, though it should eventually grow to be much more general than this.

OPTIONS
-------

*-v*::
    Verbose mode; This option provides a large amount of diagnostic
    information.
*-V*::
    Prints the version of the program and exits
*-h*::
    Prints the help text and exits
*-W* File::
    Accepts a whitelist file of functions that should be assumed safe by sfpv.
    The whitelist file consists of a series of function names delimited by any
    whitespace. Note that only one whitelist file may be provided for each
    invocation.
*-C* Options::
    Accepts clang options directly in the form of a string containing clang
    arguments delimited by spaces. Note that only one Option string can be
    provided per each invocation.
