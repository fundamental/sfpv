sfpv - Static Function Property Verification

sfpv is a clang based static analysis tool to verify that functions have some
listed property through the use of annotations and a basic deduction system.
The primary goal of this program is to show realtime safety bugs in audio
software, though it should eventually grow to be much more general than this.

Right now the system is in rough shape, though it should become usable with
time.
